## About
This project is a site that provides informations about the pokémons in a visually simple way. All the information provided is obtained from the awesome [Pokéapi](https://pokeapi.co/), which is an API that serves data on pokémon. The project was made with desktops in mind.

The site was developed using the HTML, CSS and JS web technologies. Having as its main purpose help me practice these languages and, mainly, asynchronous javascript concepts such as the `async` and `await` syntaxes and the promises.

## Accessing
Accessing the pokédex is as simple as clicking this [link](https://nadjielse.github.io/pokedex/).
